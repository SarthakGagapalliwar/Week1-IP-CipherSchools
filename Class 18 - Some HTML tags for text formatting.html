    <h2>the poem</h2>
    <p>hat is, or supposedly is, susceptible of being sung to the <strong> accompaniment </strong> of a musical instrument (in ancient times, usually a lyre) or that expresses intense personal <i>emotion</i>  in a manner suggestive of a song. Lyric poetry expresses the <del>thoughts</del>  and <em>feelings</em> of the poet and is sometimes contrasted with  narrative poetry and verse drama, which relate events in the form of a story. Elegies, odes, and sonnets <sub> are </sub>all important kinds of lyric</p>
